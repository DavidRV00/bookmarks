# Setting up bookmarks
- create standalone setup for bookmark tools + buku pkg-config
- add that stuff to artix-system
- eventually, merge it to master
- migrate all my bookmarks to the new system

- universal bookmarking applications:
	- browser
	- feeds
	- liked mpv videos
	- liked posts on websites
	- watch/read later
	- facebook saved posts
	- starred emails?

Each of the above also requires a migration process (some of which may be nice reusable tools).
